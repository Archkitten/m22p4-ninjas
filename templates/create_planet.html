            Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the Sun
            of 87.97 days is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman
            deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and never exceeds 28°
            away from the Sun when viewed from Earth. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen
            near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or early morning. At this time it may appear
            as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet
            telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in
            its inner orbit relative to Earth, which reoccurs over the so-called synodic period approximately every 116 days.
        </p>`,
        venus: `
        <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest rotation period
            (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets (meaning
            the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east). It does not have any natural satellites. It is named after the
            Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon,
            reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6 – bright enough to cast shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked
            eye in broad daylight. Orbiting within Earth's orbit, Venus is an inferior planet and never appears to venture
            far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8°.
        </p>`,
        earth: `
        <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric
            dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other
            objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26
            days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times. Earth's axis
            of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction
            between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
            Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four terrestrial planets.

    `,
        mars: `
        <p>
            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury.
            In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the
            iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies
            visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent
            both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. The days and seasons
            are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis
            relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and
            second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.
            The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.
            Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,
            similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

            one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
            Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants. Jupiter has been
            known to astronomers since antiquity. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter
            can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on
            average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

        saturn:

            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas
            giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density
            of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.Saturn is named after the
            Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. Saturn's interior is probably
            composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer
            of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer.
            Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic
             hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a
              magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is
              around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although
            long-lived features can appear.

            Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the
            fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times
            the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than
            Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun once
            every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and
            has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident. Neptune is not visible to the unaided
            eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation.
            Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational
            perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann
            Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly
            thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.

        uranus:
            `<p>
            Uranus (from the Latin name Ūranus for the Greek god Οὐρανός) is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest
            planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune,
            and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this
            reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus'
            atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains
            more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary
            atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud
            structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of
            Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.
